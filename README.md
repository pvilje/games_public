# Public games
Simply a variety of games written mostly (so far all of them) in Python.

Simple command prompt games... 

## Running the games
### Option 1, just run it
Just running the python files will start the games with some default settings.

### Option 2, import 
All games are class based should be possible to import.<br />
this option is better if you want to fiddle with the settings.


## About the code
The code written in these files is intended first of all to be readable. i do not put any effort what so ever in writing as few lines as possible (or many lines for that matter). Frankly I just start typing and whatever ends up working is likelly to be part of the final code... 

The result may or may not be well structured, sort of depends on how much time I have to put into it when I start. 


Enjoy
