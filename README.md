# Public games
Simply a variety of games written mostly (so far all of them) in Python.

Simple command prompt games... 

## Running the games
### Option 1, just run it
Just runnning the python files will start the games with some default settings.

### Option 2, import 
All games are class based should be possible to import.<br />
this option is better if you want to fiddle with the settings.

Enjoy
